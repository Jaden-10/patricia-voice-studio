git commit -m "URGENT: Fix admin login by adding automatic database seeding

Critical fixes for admin authentication:
- Add automatic database seeding on server startup
- Import seedDatabase function in server.ts
- Run seeding after database initialization
- Ensure admin account is always created with correct credentials
- Add verification that admin user exists with proper role
- Use exact email: patricia@songbirdvoicestudio.com
- Use password: admin123 (properly hashed with bcrypt)
- Set role: admin with verified status

Admin login will now work immediately after deployment.
