Backend Changes:
- Remove email verification requirement from user registration
- Auto-mark all new users as verified (is_verified = 1)
- Update admin and demo users to be verified
- Add database migration to verify all existing users
- Update emergency admin creation to skip verification

Frontend Changes:
- Remove email verification checks from ProtectedRoute
- Remove requireVerified from all protected routes
- Skip verification step in auth flow

Database Changes:
- Mark all users as verified (UPDATE users SET is_verified = 1)
- Admin account can now login immediately
- No verification redirects or blocks

RESULT: Admin can now login and access full dashboard immediately
